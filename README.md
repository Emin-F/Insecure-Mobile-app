# Insecure-Mobile-app
Mobile app design insecure for security practices

- *Setup*
  
There ise a two important file on the repo first one .apk file and other one is .js file. 

First download two of them and open the .apk file on your device or emulator.

After that open the vscode or any IDE for .js file, I use express and mysql for taking requests and produce SQLI, etc.

on the terminal run the following commands

npm install mysql2
npm install mysql
npm install express
brew install node

Okay you are redy to run .js file "node main.js" if everything is okay you can see "Server running on port 300" message on the console when you visit the localhost:3000 

After that you can open the mobile app on the right side there is a menu you can switch the schenarios using that.

First 3 schenario based on the mobile app (Insecure Storage, Webview, XSS via webview) others happens on the web app (SQL Injection, IDOR and Authentication bypass), happy hacking.
